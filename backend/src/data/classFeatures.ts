        { level: 1, name: 'Spellcasting', description: 'As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. See the Player\'s Handbook for rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as a Wizard.\n\nCantrips. You know three cantrips of your choice from the Wizard spell list. Light, Mage Hand and Ray of Frost are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice. When you reach levels 4 and 10 in this class, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard table.\nSpellbook. Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book in your possession: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, and it contains 100 pages, which can be read only by you or someone casting Identify. You determine the book\'s appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound together by twine. The book contains the spells you know of level 1 and higher. It starts with six level 1 spells of your choice from the Wizard spell list. Detect Magic, Feather Fall, Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Sleep and Thunderwave are recommended. Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.\nSpell Slots. The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of level 1 and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\'s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Wizard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you\'re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If another Wizard feature gives spells that you always have prepared, those spells don\'t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this Spellcasting feature, but those spells otherwise follow the rules in this feature.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing one or more of the spells there. Preparing a new list requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast a spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell you add to the list.\nSpellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with your Wizard features.\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you cast with your Wizard features.\n\nEXPANDING AND REPLACING YOUR SPELLBOOK\n\nThe spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the magical research you conduct on your own, but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to your book. You could discover a spell on a Spell Scroll or in an ancient tome, for example, and then copy the spell into your spellbook, using the process below.\n\nCopying a Spell into the Book. When you find a Wizard spell of level 1 or higher, you can copy it into your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. The cost represents the fine inks you use as well as Material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like the other spells in your spellbook.\nReplacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster and easier, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.' },
