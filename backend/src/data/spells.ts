Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall’s water doesn’t fill it.'

If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell\'s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.\nA bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.\n\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.'

Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.\nIf the wall cuts through a creature\'s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.\nThe wall can have any shape you desire, though it can\'t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn\'t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp. If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.\nThe wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM\'s discretion.\nIf you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can\'t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.'

For example, you could create an illusion of yourself that appears and warns off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.'

For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature\'s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don\'t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light centered on the glyph. Any creature in the sphere when the glyph is triggered is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\n**Death.** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.\n**Discord.** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\n**Fear.** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.\n**Hopelessness.** Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can\'t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.\n**Insanity.** Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can\'t take actions, can\'t understand what other creatures say, can\'t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The GM controls its movement, which is erratic.\n**Pain.** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.\n**Sleep.** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.\n**Stunning.** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.'

        description: 'This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can\'t be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls d100 and consults the table.\n**Familiarity.** "Permanent circle" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. "Associated object" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard\'s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich\'s secret vault.\n"Very familiar" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. "Seen casually" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren\'t very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. "Description" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else\'s description, perhaps from a map.\n"False destination" is a place that doesn\'t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy\'s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.\n**On Target.** You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.\n**Off Target.** You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\n**Similar Area.** You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that\'s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard\'s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\n**Mishap.** The spell\'s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).'

If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\n**Spells.** Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\n**Magic Items.** The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.\nA magic weapon\'s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\n**Magical Travel.** Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.\n**Creatures and Objects.** A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere.

When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target.

Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.\nThe wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.\nThe wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall\'s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer\'s properties as described below.\nThe wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it.\n**Red.** The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can\'t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed with a dispel magic spell cast using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, or by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.\n**Orange.** The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can\'t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed with a dispel magic spell cast using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, or by dealing at least 50 force damage to it.\n**Yellow.** The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed with a dispel magic spell cast using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, or by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.\n**Green.** The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal in a barrier, destroys this layer.\n**Blue.** The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed with a dispel magic spell cast using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, or by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.\n**Indigo.** On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don\'t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.\nWhile this layer is in place, spells can\'t be cast through the wall. The layer can be destroyed with a dispel magic spell cast using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, or by dealing at least 25 radiant damage to it.\n**Violet.** On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the DM\'s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn\'t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer can be destroyed with a dispel magic spell cast using a spell slot of 9th level, or by dealing at least 25 force damage to it.'

You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.\nWhen you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature\'s shape and size. Your equipment doesn\'t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can\'t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect until you leave the new form.\nYou can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.'

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don\'t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n- You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn\'t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.\n- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\n- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich\'s life drain attack.\n- You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent\'s successful save, a foe\'s critical hit, or a friend\'s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item\'s current owner.\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell, and this damage can\'t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn\'t already 3, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.'
